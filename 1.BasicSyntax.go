/*
This first file of GoLang tutorial tells the basic synax of a Go program. A basic Go program has the following syntax.
*/

package main

import(
  "fmt"
)

func main(){
  fmt.Println("Hello Golang") 
}

/*
The first line of every Go program is a package declaration. All our code of go is kept in that package.

The second line of code helps import other packages to use in our program for different purposes. Every step in a go program needs a package. One of the common pacages in Golang is "fmt".

The third line present there is the declaration of the main function, the place in code from where the main execution of program starts.
